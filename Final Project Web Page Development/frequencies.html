		 <h2>Frequencies of Tornadoes</h2>
		 <p>Tornadoes occur more frequently in certain regions and during specific times of the year.</p>
		 <p>Factors such as geography, climate, and atmospheric conditions influence the frequency of tornado occurrences.</p>
		 <p>In regions known as "Tornado Alley," tornadoes are more common due to the convergence of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from Canada.</p>
		 <p>Statistically, Tornado Alley experiences a higher frequency of tornadoes compared to areas outside of Tornado Alley. However, tornadoes can still occur in other regions, albeit less frequently.</p>
		 <p>It's essential for residents and authorities in all areas to be prepared for tornadoes, regardless of their likelihood of occurrence.</p>
