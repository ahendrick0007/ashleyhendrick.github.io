        <h2>Impacts of Tornadoes</h2>
        <h3>What Happens During a Tornado</h3>
        <p>A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. During a tornado, violent winds spiral around a central axis, causing widespread destruction along its path.</p>
        <p>Tornadoes can form with little warning and move unpredictably, making them extremely dangerous natural disasters.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Damages</h3>
        <p>Tornadoes can cause various types of damages, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structural Damage:</strong> Tornadoes can demolish buildings, homes, and infrastructure, resulting in total or partial destruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Debris Impact:</strong> Flying debris propelled by tornado winds can act as projectiles, causing additional damage to structures and posing a significant threat to human safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Flooding:</strong> Tornadoes can disrupt drainage systems and cause flash floods, exacerbating damages and hazards.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetation Destruction:</strong> Tornadoes can uproot trees, destroy crops, and strip vegetation, impacting agriculture and ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale</h3>
        <p>The intensity of tornadoes is categorized using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale, which rates tornadoes based on the estimated wind speeds and resulting damages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>EF0 - Weak:</strong> Wind speeds 65-85 mph; light damage, such as broken tree branches and minor roof damage.</li>
            <li><strong>EF1 - Moderate:</strong> Wind speeds 86-110 mph; moderate damage, including uprooted trees and significant roof damage.</li>
            <li><strong>EF2 - Strong:</strong> Wind speeds 111-135 mph; considerable damage, with roofs torn off buildings and mobile homes overturned.</li>
            <li><strong>EF3 - Severe:</strong> Wind speeds 136-165 mph; severe damage, with well-built homes completely destroyed and large trees uprooted.</li>
            <li><strong>EF4 - Devastating:</strong> Wind speeds 166-200 mph; devastating damage, including entire neighborhoods leveled and cars thrown considerable distances.</li>
            <li><strong>EF5 - Incredible:</strong> Wind speeds over 200 mph; catastrophic damage, with strong frame houses leveled to the ground and large objects become airborne missiles.</li>
        </ul>
