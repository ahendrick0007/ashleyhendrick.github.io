        <h2>Seasons of Tornadoes</h2>
        <p>Tornadoes can occur throughout the year, but certain seasons are more conducive to their formation.</p>
        <p>In the United States, tornado season typically peaks in spring, from March to June.</p>
        <p>During spring, the clash of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico with cooler, drier air from the north creates ideal conditions for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.</p>
        <p>However, tornadoes can also occur in other seasons, such as summer and fall, especially in regions with more moderate climates.</p>
        <p>It's essential for residents in tornado-prone areas to stay informed about weather forecasts and preparedness measures year-round.</p>

                <h3>Spring</h3>
                <p>Spring is the primary tornado season in many parts of the United States.</p>
                <p>Tornadoes during spring are often associated with severe thunderstorms and warm, moist air masses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Summer</h3>
                <p>Tornadoes can still occur in summer, although they are less frequent compared to spring.</p>
                <p>Summer tornadoes are often linked to strong frontal systems and localized storm activity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Fall</h3>
                <p>Fall tornadoes are more common in certain regions with transitional weather patterns.</p>
                <p>These tornadoes can occur along cold fronts or within remnants of tropical systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Winter</h3>
                <p>While rare, tornadoes can still occur in winter, especially in regions with milder climates.</p>
                <p>Winter tornadoes are often associated with strong low-pressure systems and atmospheric instability.</p>
