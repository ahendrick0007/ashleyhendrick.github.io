        <h2>Prevention and Safety Measures</h2>
        <p>Staying safe during a tornado requires preparedness and awareness. The following are different ways to stay safe based on your location:</p>
        
        <h3>At Home</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Have a Plan:</strong> Create a family tornado plan, including identifying a safe room or shelter in your home, such as a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor without windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare an Emergency Kit:</strong> Keep an emergency kit with essentials such as water, non-perishable food, flashlight, batteries, and a first aid kit.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Monitor weather forecasts and warnings using a NOAA Weather Radio or a reliable weather app on your smartphone.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Drills:</strong> Conduct tornado drills with your family to ensure everyone knows what to do during a tornado warning.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>At Work or School</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Know the Plan:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the tornado safety plan at your workplace or school, including evacuation routes and designated safe areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> Pay attention to weather updates and heed tornado warnings issued by authorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Instructions:</strong> Follow instructions from emergency personnel and evacuate to designated safe areas immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Account for Others:</strong> If responsible for others, such as students or coworkers, ensure everyone is accounted for and safely evacuated.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Outdoors or in a Vehicle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Seek Shelter Immediately:</strong> If outdoors, seek shelter in a sturdy building or lie flat in a low-lying area and cover your head with your hands.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Vehicles:</strong> Do not try to outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Instead, abandon the vehicle and seek shelter in a nearby building or lie flat in a ditch.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Pay attention to weather updates and take shelter if a tornado warning is issued for your location.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Prepared:</strong> Keep a portable emergency kit in your vehicle with essentials such as water, snacks, a flashlight, and a blanket.</li>
        </ul>
